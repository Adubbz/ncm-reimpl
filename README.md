## NCM Reimpl

This is/will be a work in progress attempt at reimplementing the NCM sysmodule for the Nintendo Switch. This project is incomplete, and I make no guarantees if/when it will be completed. Expect many mistakes and bugs. 

The main purpose of this is that I have 0 experience with this sort of thing and I'd like to change that :). Thus, I welcome constructive feedback on my work, as this is something I would like to get better at. Any assistance is also appreciated.

This is currently based on 8.1.0's version of NCM, with other firmwares supported once this is tested to be working and is "complete".
